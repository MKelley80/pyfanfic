##Money and Licensing

First off, there is no money. This anthology is a labor of love and your submission is a contribution to the PyLadies Auction. We’re planning to make the anthology available online for free. We’ll also be printing a limited run of copies as a fundraiser for PyLadies. Those print copies will only be available to contributors and through the PyLadies Auction at PyCon 2019 in Cleveland.

We’ll be using a CC-BY-SA license (free to share, as long as everything is attributed correctly. We’d also like any contributors to consider offering any originals (especially art) as an additional donation for the PyLadies Auction.
