##Money and Licensing

First off, there is no money. This anthology is a labor of love. We’re planning to make the anthology available online for free. We’ll also be printing a limited run of copies as a fundraiser for PyLadies. Those print copies will only be available to contributors and through the PyLadies Auction at PyCon 2019 in Cleveland.

We’ll be using a [CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/) (free to share, as long as everything is attributed correctly. We’d also like any contributors to consider offering any originals (especially art) as a donation for the PyLadies Auction.
